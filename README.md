# Portfolio
This is my personal developer portfolio website, designed and developed using pure HTML and CSS, with a touch of JavaScript to add interactivity. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills, projects, and journey as a frontend developer. I focused on creating a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface that works smoothly on all devices. This portfolio represents not just my work, but also my growth and passion in the field of web development and UI/UX design.

I built this project from scratch to learn and implement modern web design practices, and I continue to update it as I grow in my career. Itâ€™s hosted live on Netlify and acts as a digital introduction to who I am, what Iâ€™ve done, and what I aim to do as a developer.
